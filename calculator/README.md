# Welcome to KodeKloud Advanced GoLang Exercises :rocket:

This is your Visual Studio Code editor where you will practice developing your GoLang Programs.

To begin with :tropical_drink: relax and start working on the quizzes on the left.

<br/>

**_Note:_** Some of the questions on the left would require you write go programs and/or run go commands.
To do this, follow the below steps:

1. Create a file with `.go` extension. For example: `main.go`
2. Write your program
3. Open the terminal (see instructions below)

   **_Mac users:_**<br/>
   Ctrl + `

   **_Windows/Linux users:_**<br/>
   Ctrl + Shift + `

4. To run your program, type `go run <name_of_the_file>` in the terminal. For example - `go run main.go`.

You would be able to see the output/errors(if any) in the console.

All the best! :muscle:
